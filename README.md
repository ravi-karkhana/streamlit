# Part Manufacturing Cost Calculation

The Part Manufacturing Cost Calculation repository is a project aimed at automating the cost estimation process for part manufacturing based on CAD data and configuration inputs. 
By leveraging machine learning techniques, 
this repository predicts the cost of manufacturing a part, 
providing valuable insights for pricing decisions and resource allocation.

## Features

- CAD Data Analysis: The repository extracts relevant features from CAD files, including material usage, dimensions, complexity, and other specifications.
- Configuration Inputs: Additional configuration data is used to enhance the accuracy of the cost estimation, considering factors such as production volume, manufacturing process, and desired quality standards.
- Predictive Modeling: Machine learning algorithms are employed to build a predictive model that determines the manufacturing cost based on the extracted features and configuration inputs.
- Cost Optimization: By accurately predicting manufacturing costs, businesses can optimize pricing strategies, assess project feasibility, and make informed decisions about resource allocation.
